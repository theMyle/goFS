Implement sorting algorithm:

1. Scan the directory for files and folders
2. for each folder scanned, scan the folders inside it recursively
3. store the folder name and the files (and folders) inside it. (Do it also recursively unitl there are no folders left)

root -
      |- Folder1 --
      |- File1     |- Folder2 -----------
      |- File2     |- Folder3 --        |- File6
      |- File..    |- File3    |- File4 |- File7
      			       |- File5 |- File8

root = [Folder1, File1, File2, File..]
Folder1 = [Folder2, Folder3, File3]
Folder2 = [File6, File7, File8]
Folder3 = [File4, File5]
